PREPROCESSING
=============================================
Required input:
 Run Quater-car Matlab simulation module to produce single-defect cases. The module is provided by Asmus Skar, DTU Civil Engineering). Save output files in Matlab-files directory.

Prepare data using scripts from data_preparation_module directory.
 a) Run data_preparation_module/process_matlab_files.py to process matlab files and create train-val-test files
 b) Run data_preparation_module/normalize_data.py to create train-val-test-normalized files
 c) Run data_preparation_module/transform_to_window_dataset.pyto create train-val-test-normalized-split-into-windows
 Please provide correct input and output directories as arguments when running the scripts.

Output is the data directory with the following subdirectories:
  - Matlab-files (=Required input): output of simulation module - each .mat file corresponds to one defect type, geometry and speed.
  - train-val-test: pickled Pandas dataframes where each row stores information about one simulation.
    Stored is the full file ('full_simulation.pkl') and train/valid/test files (60%/20%/20% split).
    The too narrow defects without any point recorded with the selected sampling frequency are removed.
  - train-val-test-normalized: the train-val-test/train.pkl file is scaled to 0-1 range. The scaler info is saved and applied to
    valid and test files.
  - train-val-test-normalized-split-into-windows: A sliding window of size = 2m and a step of 1 point is applied on train/valid/test files from train-val-test-normalized.
  - scaler.pkl: train scaler file.
